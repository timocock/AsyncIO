LARGE TEST FILE - Testing AsyncIO buffer boundaries and large file handling

This file is designed to test AsyncIO's double-buffered asynchronous I/O system
with files that are larger than the buffer size. The AsyncIO library uses two
buffers, each roughly bufferSize/2 bytes, so this file should be significantly
larger than the test buffer size to properly test the asynchronous operations.

The file contains:
- Multiple lines of varying lengths
- Content that spans buffer boundaries
- Data that requires multiple async operations
- Mixed text patterns to verify data integrity

Line 1: Short line
Line 2: Medium length line with some content
Line 3: Longer line with more detailed content to test buffer handling
Line 4: Very long line that should definitely span across buffer boundaries and require the AsyncIO library to properly manage the double-buffered system with background operations
Line 5: Another medium line
Line 6: Short again
Line 7: Extremely long line that contains a lot of repetitive text to fill up buffers and test the asynchronous nature of the I/O operations, ensuring that the library properly handles background operations while the application continues processing
Line 8: Back to short
Line 9: Medium length content
Line 10: Final line with end marker

This file should be large enough to test:
- Buffer boundary crossing
- Multiple async operations
- Background I/O completion
- Data integrity across buffers
- Seek operations in large files
- Read/write operations spanning multiple buffers
